# Use Case: Verifiable Fairness in Leverage Exchanges

## Problem

Leverage exchanges often face accusations of:

- **Manipulation**: Claims of unfair price movements or liquidation events.  
- **Lack of Transparency**: Users cannot verify if the platform's operations are unbiased.  
- **Trust Issues**: Centralized systems create a barrier to trust, especially in liquidation and margin calculations.

## Solution

Integrate your **Living Hash Engine** and **KeccakBlackBox-Engine** to create a verifiable, transparent, and trustless backend for leverage exchanges, ensuring that:

### Randomness in Liquidations
- Use your system to generate verifiable randomness for liquidation orders, ensuring no bias in the process.

### Traceable Pricing
- Log price feed inputs and calculations using the Keccak sponge, providing a traceable history for price movements.

### Proof of Fairness
- Publish **Merkle proofs** for all critical operations (e.g., random liquidation selection, margin calculation), allowing users to independently verify fairness.

## How It Works

### Price Feeds

- Absorb price feed data into the **Living Hash Engine** and trace every operation (e.g., moving averages, volatility calculations).  
- Use the **BlackBox Engine** to store these traces on-chain, creating an immutable record.

### Liquidation Process

- Utilize the **commit-reveal pattern** to ensure randomness in selecting liquidation orders.  
- Publish **Merkle proofs** for the process so users can verify that no manipulation occurred.

### Auditable Records

- Provide users and auditors with access to the trace logs and Merkle proofs through a **public frontend** or **API**.
